 * The ABI between a Tab5 launcher and the apps it loads with esp_elf.
 *
 * An app is an ELF built by feckless_abi_elf() (project_include.cmake):
 * its own code and whatever it links statically, with every call into
 * the feckless libraries, FreeRTOS, the heap, the timer, the log, libc,
 * libm and libgcc left undefined. exports.txt is the list it may leave
 * undefined; the launcher hands esp_elf a table of the same list.
 *
 * An app initialises the board as a firmware of its own would, and may
 * find it already up: a launcher runs it on the board it was using.
 * tab5io_init(), lcd_init(), gfx_init(), touch_init() and usbhost_init()
 * return ESP_OK again, a USB class registered late is installed, and
 * the rest -- audio_out_init(), uac_init(), hid_init(), battery_init(),
 * rtc8130_init() -- are the app's: a launcher does not call them.
